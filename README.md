# Researching BLE ( Bluetooth Low Energy) and NFC (Near Field Communication) for use as a
personal identification service to unlock a vehicle.

2. Project Summary
The goal of my project is to examine which technology is better suited for identifying a person
when paired with a smartphone. To do this, we will more be examining the area of car keys to
see if we can use our smartphones reliably as a car key and to potentially allow for other features
and options. The goal is to create an application that can securely communicate via Bluetooth
low energy or NFC to demonstrate that we can use modern phones to supplement the use of a
traditional car key and so that we can enable other abilities, one of these features which I am
trying to implement is the ability to remotely give temporary access to your vehicle for a set
amount of time. Other features would be to determine what doors to unlock and like in more
modern and premium vehicles to specify to auto open specific doors. I hope to determine the
strengths and weaknesses of both NFC and BLE by investigating various manners from
capabilities, limitations, security and ease of implementation and possibly come to a conclusion
on which technology is better suited to this function.

3. Context
Mobile phones are becoming an increasing part of our lives and many consider them an
extension of ourselves. Many people are becoming more reliant upon them, even now
Google/Apple pay are becoming increasingly popular and they cut back on the need to leave the
house with a wallet. Recent years have shown us how phones can be treated as personal
identifiers to allow us to make our daily lives much easier. Two technologies that will best
facilitate this use of phones are NFC (Near Field Communication) and BLE (Bluetooth Low
Energy). These technologies, while quite different will allow for a similar use case, the ability to
detect devices in a nearby location and to send and receive information to identify a user and
unlock their vehicle if it is authorised to do so.

Built using Android studio(acting as the key) and a Raspberry Pi(acting as the door lock).
